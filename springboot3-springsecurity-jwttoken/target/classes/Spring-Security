The incoming request will be handled by DelegatingFilterProxy, 
and converts the request to authentication object.
Since filter doesn't have any logic to authenticate the request, it pass the request to
Authentication Manager.
Authentication manager also doesn't know how to authenticate the request, so it passes the request 
to authentication provider.  
Spring has multiple authentication provider, and authentication manager cannot directly communicate
with the authentication provider.
So to talk with authentication provider, authentication manager passes the request to provider manager
and the provider manager passes the request to appropriate authentication provider 
by checking each authentication providers.
